   A                Rotates camera left (relative to camera’s current orientation) 
   D                Rotates camera right (relative to camera’s current orientation) 
   W                Moves camera forward (do not change elevation (i.e., Y-coordinate)) 
   S                Moves camera backward (do not change elevation (i.e., Y-coordinate)) 
Page Up             Tilts camera up

   Q                Moves camera up (increase Y-coordinate of camera) (do not change X- or Z-coordinate) 
   Z                Moves camera down (decrease Y-coordinate of camera) (do not change X- or Z-coordinate)
